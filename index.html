      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is William Ferebee. I grew up in Midlothian, Va where I attended Midlothian High School. From there, I attended Radford Univeristy and majored in Physics. As a kid, I was always interested in Math and Science, so when I went to college I decided that I wanted to learn more about both.</p>

      <p>I currently work in the construction industry. Although I had a Science background, I realized that I wanted to work outside and use my hands more often. Over the course of the past five years, I have been learning the trade of Masonry, in wihch I have created many beautiful brick and block constructions that I am very proud of.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, I like to watch TV, go fishing, play the guitar, and play Poker. I also recently got engaged to my beautiful fiancee Lydia!</p>
